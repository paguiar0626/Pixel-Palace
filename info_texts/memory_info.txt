Use the arrow buttons to select your bet, then press Start to begin. 
Click on cards to flip them over. Attempt to find a match for each set of cards.
Each card has a partner. If the two cards you flip over match, they will remain flipped.
Keep playing until each card has been flipped over, 
and you will be rewarded with your bet payout. The payout is determined by the initial bet and how many turns have elapsed.
