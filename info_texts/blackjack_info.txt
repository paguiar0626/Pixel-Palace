Use the bet and bet multiplier to select how many credits to gamble on the game.
Select Start to begin. You may then choose to select either Stand, Hit, or Double. 
Hit will add another card to your hand. Double will add 2 cards to your hand and double your bet. Stand will hold your current cards.

The goal is to get the numbers on each of your cards to add up to as close to 21 as possible without going over. 

You will take your turn and then the computer dealer will play their turn.
The game will continue until either player reaches 21 or busts (goes over 21).
If you win the game, you will win the bet. If not, you lose the bet.
Press the Replay button to play again with the same bet.
